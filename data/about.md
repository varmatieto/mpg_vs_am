#### App description

This App is based on information related to the `mtcars` dataset (see
below).

The Apps shows the relationship between `mpg` (*miles per gallon*) and
some **key predictors** available in the dataset.  
In particular, it looks at the relationship between mpg and transmission
type `am` (automatic / manual).

Please select a variable to be shown in relationship with `mpg`. The
different shape of the points outlines the number of cylinders; the
colour of the points says the transmission type .

The plot seems to show that in small cars manual trasmission is better,
over a certain size automatic is worth.

#### Dataset description

The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and
comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and
performance for 32 automobiles (1973-74 models). A data frame contains
32 observations on 11 variables.

-   1.  `mpg` Miles/(US) gallon  
-   1.  `cyl` Number of cylinders ( 4-6-8 )  
-   1.  `disp` Displacement (cu.in.)  
-   1.  `hp` Gross horsepower  
-   1.  `drat` Rear axle ratio  
-   1.  `wt` Weight (lb/1000)  
-   1.  `qsec` 1/4 mile time  
-   1.  `vs` V/S  
-   1.  `am` Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)  
-   1.  `gear` Number of forward gears ( 3-4-5)  
-   1.  `carb` Number of carburetors ( 1:8)
